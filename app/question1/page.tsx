Hi Christy,

React is a library of functions that are used to create an applicationâ€™s frontend UI. Next.js is a framework built on top of React which makes it easier to create React applications.

There are several benefits of using Next.js to develop your applications.

- Next.js incorporates server-side rendering and static site generation, which contributes to *faster page load times* and *directly improves core web vital statistics*.
- Search engines are able to more easily read the content of your application without needing to run client-side rendering as is typically done with React applications, *directly improving SEO results.*
- Improve conversion rates as customers will both be able to more easily find your website through better SEO, and have a *better user experience* once on the website due to faster performance.
- Next.js is widely used by developers and has many resources available for developers to use when transitioning to Next.js.


More info about Next.js and its relation to React can be found **[here](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations/what-is-react-and-nextjs)**.

All the best,

Noam Zimet
