**Question 5:** How could we improve or alter this familiarization exercise?`

Overall, I thought this exercise was great. It was refreshing to work on a realistic-feeling assignment for a take-home exercise. It provided real-life examples that I would have to deal with as a customer success manager as well as gave me a chance to learn more about the product itself.

One suggestion is to provide a guide for how long responses are expected to be. In a customer email, conciseness is important as you do not want the customer to disengage from the email if itâ€™s too long. In this interview setting however, I also want to convey that my subject matter expertise, which lends itself to writing more lengthy responses. It was a challenge to strike the appropriate balance between conciseness while still ensuring my knowledge was showcased to the hiring managers.
